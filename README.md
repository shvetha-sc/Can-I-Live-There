# Can I Live There
A Potentially Habitable Exoplanet Classification Expert System Using JESS

## Description ##
Thousands of Exoplanets (Extrasolar planet) have been discovered in the past few years with telescopes like the Kepler Space Telescope and the hunt for new planets still goes on. Each of these vary in temperature, size and various other aspects. But what does it take to consider an exoplanet potentially habitable / suitable for life? The term 'potentially habitable' refers to measurable qualities of a planet that are necessary for habitable conditions. This task is usually performed manually and newer habitability matrices are added as the research progresses. ‘Can I live there’ is a rule based expert system that is designed to take a certain habitability rules and determine as to whether an exoplanet could be habitable or not based on certain habitability matrices. This system intends on being flexible since newer habitability matrices can be added without any major changes to the system.
